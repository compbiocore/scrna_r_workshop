    "section": "",
    "text": "In scRNA-seq, you can get a sense of the heterogeneity of the cells in your sample.\n\nAre there novel or rare cell types?\nWhat about cell type specific gene expression?\nDoes the distribution of different cell types change across time or treatment?\n\nThis increased resolution comes with some unique challenges.\n\nDropouts - genes that are not detected in some cells, can lead to sparse expression matrices with many zero values.\nDoublets - sequencing two cells at the same time and can’t distinguish their expression or cell types, need to filter these out during QC.\nDying cells - you will lose some cells because they are dead or dying, you can also filter these out during sample QC.\nYou also should be cautious when thinking about your sample sizes. For example, you may be sequencing thousands of cells but if they all come from the same mouse you lose the ability to generalize your findings."

    "section": "",
    "text": "- 10x sequencing encapsulates a cell, reagents, and a bead w/ primer in an oil droplet (aka GEM or Gel Bead-in EMulsion).\n- If you have a situation where one droplet has two cells, this is a ‘doublet’, you can also have empty droplets where there’s no cell encapsulated.\n\n\nAfter encapsulation of cells, beads, and reagents in the oil droplets, the bead is dissolved and releases primers.\nThe poly (dT) primers are used for generating the gene expression libraries.\nThe capture sequence primers are shown in a lighter shading because they are only used in situations where you’d like to add an extra channel of information to your experiment by using feature barcoding (cell-surface protein characterization, multiplexing, etc.).\n\nLet’s go over the details of how the library prep works\n\n\nThe polyA mRNAs are captured using the oligo(dT) on the beads, MMLV (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus) reverse transcriptase synthesizes complementary strand to the fragment thats captured.\n\n The RT adds some extra Cs on the end.\n\n\nThe template-switching oligo is added so we can continue across the other strand.\n\n\nAdd primers to amplify full length cDNA\n\n\nFragment cDNA, perform A-tailing\n\n\nAt this point we add the Truseq adapters, product 3 is what you’ll actually sequence.\n\n\nAdd the library PCR primers 1 and 2 to amplify the library\n\n\nThe final library structure looks like the above image – the exact length of the UMI might depend on which chemistry you’re using.\n\n\nThe actual sequencing looks like the above image – Truseq Read 1 uses bottom strand as template and sequences the bacrode + UMI, Sample Index primer sequences the sample index using bottom strand as template. Regenerate clusters and Truseq Read 2 primer sequences the second read using the top strand as template.\n\n\n- The above steps assume a single index library, if you’re using dual indexes there will be another sample index between the P5 and Truseq Read 1 (see above image).\n- Dual indexed libraries are beneficial to help prevent index hopping.\n- Here is an excellent resource for information about the resulting library structures for 10x libraries (and other single cell technologies like Drop-seq or SMART-seq) and was our resource for most of this section."
