- Familiarity with 10x Genomics gene expression and multimodal data library preparation.
- Familiarity with cellranger outputs and importing them into R.
- Deep knowledge of Seurat object structure and data storage.
- Understanding of metrics for QCing and filtering data.
- Merging and integrating multiple datasets, the difference between them, and when they are appropriate to use.
- Understanding how to classify cell types using Seurat TransferAnchors and the distinction between data transfer and data integration.
- Understanding of how and why we normalize data using SCTransform.
- Data visualization functions in Seurat and their default behaviors.
- Understanding of parallelization options in Seurat and other R packages.
- Importing CITE-seq data in Seurat.
